GreenHat PureHarmony is an initiative for open source app software infrastructure, that is a UK initiative as a global bridge connecting ecosystem that is ready for re-licensed proprietary commercial use under Permissive license from Apache, MIT, Eclipse licenses under the mixed model. White label apps supply chain on full front and backend applications for western software services industry with Western Europe as the bridge for neutral app development on neutral platforms such as European Eclipse Oniro platform project with wider OpenAtom OpenHarmony based alongside AOSP-based  platforms that utilise React Native, other UI frameworks alongside primary native ArkUI/ArkUI-X cross platform, [Open Mobile Hub](https://github.com/openmobilehub) framework integrated as a turnkey solution in western markets, integrating open source stack Open Mobile Hub and apps built from scratch on open source, utilising the power of open source. Helping clients build and tap into wider markets of large customers potentials in geopolitical challenges on interoperability and compatibility of applications market.

What's the Objective?
We aim to pitch to global industry services developers from the western market to expand their applications onto the third major global platform outside duopoly platforms such as Apple iOS and Google GMS Android, Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Apple WatchOS, Google WearOS proprietary mobile, desktop and wearable computing infrastructure controlled by one country vendor locked within few corporations making app compatibility harder, limiting user base, balkanising and fragmenting ecosystems, limiting normal global business activities hurting their customers and ultimately limiting innovation in the global marketplace that breaks EU Digital Markets Act and UK CMA - Competition and Markets Authority regulations.

Hybrid Approach: Liberapay + OCE
For cost efficiency and compliance readiness, consider a phased strategy:

Phase 1 (Early Stage)

Use Liberapay for small donations and community support.

Keep costs low while validating demand for your white-label apps.

Phase 2 (Growth Stage)

Transition to OCE once:

Secure corporate sponsors or EU grants.

Need VAT-compliant invoicing for clients.

Require fiscal hosting for legal protection. 

[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/PureHarmony/) is a low-risk, low-cost starting point for early-stage fundraising, but PureHarmony will likely outgrow it quickly due to its commercial focus and EU compliance needs. Using Liberapay to bootstrap, then migrate to OCE when scaling partnerships or grants covering OCE fundraising launch early fees. After that successful OCE post-fundraising, using fundraised capital to cover OCE fee costs.

<!-- Welcome to PureHarmony platform based on Oniro
PureHarmony hosts the code and repositories for add-ons and enhancements to the OpenHarmony project. These enhancements are part of the base OS, Oniro Project, an open-source, vendor-neutral operating system managed by the Eclipse Foundation.

Objective of the Project
The goal of this project is to build upon Oniro-OpenHarmony, extending it with additional functionalities tailored for global markets. OpenHarmony-Oniro, HarmonyOS as a open source community and commercial bridge for industry.
